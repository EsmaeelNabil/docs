Input Formats supported by nuclei can be grouped into two categories:

- **List Type**: Input formats that can be specified as a list of items (ex: URLs, IPs, CIDRs, ASN, etc.)

- **Http Request Type**: Input formats that contain info of complete HTTP request and that cannot be expressed as a list of items (ex: OpenAPI Schema, Proxify Traffic Logs, etc.)


### List Type

List type formats can be specified in the following ways:

1. **`-u` flag**:

     Comma Seperated list of values (ex: `-u scanme.sh,127.0.0.1,AS1337,192.168.1.0/24`) 

2. **`-l` flag**:

     File containing list of values (ex: `-l urls.txt`)

3. **via stdin (or pipe)**:

     List of values can be passed via stdin (ex: `cat urls.txt | nuclei`) or piped from other tools (ex: `mytool | nuclei`)


Following are the list type formats supported by nuclei:

- **URLS**: A URL like `https://projectdiscover.io`

- **IPs**: Ipv4 or Ipv6 address like `127.0.0.1` or `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

- **CIDRs**: CIDR range like `192.168.1.0/24`

- **ASNs**: Autonomous System Number like `AS1337`

- **Domains**: Domain or Subdomain name like `projectdiscovery.io`


### Http Request Type

Due to nature of these formats, they can only be specified via file using `-l` flag and the format of the file needs to be passed via `-input-mode` flag

```
nuclei -l [format-file] -input-mode [format]
```

These formats can furthur be classified into two types based on their usage:

- **API Specification**:

    Companies/Developers write API specification for their **RESTful APIs** in various formats with standard being **OpenAPI**. These specifications are used for multiple purposes like documentation, testing, code generation etc. 

    **Nuclei with v3.2.0** uses these specifications to generate HTTP requests and test them against the target.

    Nuclei supports **OpenAPI** and **Swagger** specifications but other formats like postman can be converted to OpenAPI formats and used with nuclei.

    For example, using **OpenAPI** schema in nuclei is as simple as:

    ```
    nuclei -l openapi.yaml -im openapi
    ```

    Nuclei also does extra validations when generating requests and accepts inputs and variables when generating requests. refer [openapi-validations](#openapi-validation) for more details.


- **Request-Response Logs generated by applications**
