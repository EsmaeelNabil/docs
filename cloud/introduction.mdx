## What is ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform? 

[ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform](https://projectdiscovery.io/platform) or PDCP is a cloud-hosted security platform designed to provide continuous visibility across your external attack surface by detecting exploitable vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. 
It is built to solve a variety of use cases; and scale to support the key workflows application security teams need to secure their infrastructure.

## How are we different?

### Addressing vulnerabilites at scale

You need tools that can keep pace with the evolving range of technologies and the continuously shifting landscape of vulnerabiltiies. 
With our platform you can rapidly scan and verify a trending vulnerability across your entire tech stack. Save time and prioritize your resources 
around the vulnerabilites that matter the most. 

### A source of truth

Signal to noise. The scope of vulnerabilites means that the quantity of noise, in the form of false positives, is endless. More than a simple 
annoyance false positives are a costly distraction from real threats. Accuracy is game changing and can be critical to effective vulnerability management. 
_Studies have shown that organizations waste an average of 50% of their time chasing false positives during triaging._ 

Our templates carry comprehensive information about each vulnerability. They include descriptions, remediation steps, severity, and the inner workings of test. 
This transparency allows security engineers to easily triage, collaborate, and validate findings, while developers reproduce and verify fixes. 

### Custom automation

No two organizations are identical, and neither are their security needs. Modern security teams need to automate vulnerability detection specific to their organization and tech stack. 
Our open template language (YAML) allows fleibility and customizations so you can easily convert your internal vulnerability knowledge and findings (e.g. pen-test, bug bounty reports) into automation.
Use your custom templates to easily scan other similarly affected tech stacks and any associated regressions.
