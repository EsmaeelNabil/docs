ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform combines real-world attack detection with comprehensive vulnerability management. By leveraging our battle-tested open-source security tools used by over 100,000 security professionals worldwide, our platform helps organizations focus on what matters most - truly exploitable security risks:

- **Detect Real Threats**: Stay ahead of trending internet attacks with community-powered security templates
- **Validate Exploitability**: Focus only on vulnerabilities that attackers can actually exploit
- **Streamline Security**: Transform traditional vulnerability management into a risk-based program
- **Accelerate Response**: Quickly validate and remediate exploitable threats with clear proof of concepts

Our platform uniquely combines Vulnerability Management, Attack Surface Management, and Continuous Threat Exposure Management into a single, exploitability-focused solution with zero setup overhead - helping you manage security risks the way attackers see them, right from day one.
