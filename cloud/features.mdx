## What are PDCP's key features? 
Explore some of the main capabilities included with PDCP. 

### Hosted solution

As a hosted offering, PDCP abstracts away the complexities of running Nuclei and other ProjectDiscovery open source tools at scale. 
The cloud scanning engine completes scans +50x faster than Nuclei, enabling scans for an entire external attack surface in less than an hour.

### Asset discovery and management

The ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform will integrate our popular reconnaissance tools like subfinder, naabu, httpx, and katana to provide an outside-in view of your publicly facing assets. 
This approach captures assets that may fall out of the purview of traditional AWS / GCP / Azure inventory lists but remain exploitable by external bad actors. 

### Remediation and regression testing workflows

Support for two-way integrations with JIRA, ServiceNow, and other ticketing systems to accelerate time to remediation. The Cloud Platform can also run regression tests from AI-generated custom templates to ensure fixed issues do not resurface in the future.

### Reporting 

Export capabilities through PDF reports and exporting findings via API to demonstrate continuous coverage to senior management. 
Example KPIs would include assets discovered in the last 30 days, new exploitable vulnerabilities detected, average time to remediation, number of open exploitable vulnerabilities, etc.

### Early template access

Exclusive access to new template releases before they are released to our community. Early access to template releases provides you and your teams extra time to remediate vulnerabilities before the bug bounty community submits reports.

### SSO, RBAC, and team support

Collaborate with your team and share findings in a team workspace. Support will include SSO, SAML, SCIM, RBAC, to meet enterprise security requirements.

### Support

Direct access to the ProjectDiscovery team for support on optimal configurations, writing advanced custom templates, and anything else you need to ensure PDCP meets your security needs.
