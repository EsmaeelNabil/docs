## Summary 

Review this example to walk through the steps you need to get started with identifying the assets you want to protect.

In this use case we identify the important steps for your organization to determine the range of assets that you manage that need to be protected. 

For organizations that have visibility into their technical stack or inventory, you can easily upload a list of assets to the Cloud platform or use this [API endpoint.](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/api-reference/assets/upload-asset )

For users that do not have a full list of assets we have two options:

- **Discovery (early Beta)** - This is the simplest approach for a quick understanding of your exposed assets. Discovery is supported by multiple open source ProjectDiscovery tools to find subdomains, ports, and endpoints that are exposed on the internet. 

   - *Note: We are actively building this feature. Discovery will continue to expand and improve to reflect the robust scope found in our open source tools.*

- **Cloud Integration** - This feature supports numerous cloud service providers (AWS,GCP, Azure, CloudFlare, Fastly, and others). Once integration is configured the Cloud Platform polls the configured cloud service provider to continuously update
for any changes made by your team.

## Add Assets

You have two different options to add assets aside from upload.

### Add a Cloud Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Assets">
    Navigate to https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/assets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your option to Add">
    Choose **Cloud Integrations** from the subsections at the top and **Connect New**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a cloud provider">
    Select from the options for cloud service providers and provide the configuration details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify config">
    Select **Verify** to complete the configuration and get the Cloud Platform started on discovering your assets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add Discovery

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Assets">
    Navigate to https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/assets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your option to Add">
    Choose **Discovery** from the subsections at the top and **Auto Discovery**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide your Asset details">
    Name your Assets and provide the domains, IPs, or CIDR ranges you want to enumerate. Select the discovery settings you 
    want to apply and the frequency.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create config">
    Select **Create** to complete the configuration and get the Cloud Platform started on discovering your assets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After adding your assets to PDCP you're ready to start scanning. Using Cloud Integration or Discovery has set you up to ensure that the assets you added are maintained and up to date for scanning. 


## What's Next? 

Now that you've defined the Assets you want the Cloud Platform to identify you can move on to building your scans and evaluating any discovered vulnerabilities.
