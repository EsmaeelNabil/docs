## Summary 

Walk through the steps you need to identify the assets in your environment that you want to protect.

For organizations that have visibility into their technical stack or inventory, you can easily upload a list of assets to the Cloud platform or use this [API endpoint.](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/api-reference/assets/upload-asset )

For users that do not have a full list of assets we have two options:

- **Discovery (early Beta)** - This is the simplest approach for a quick understanding of your exposed assets. Discovery is supported by multiple open source ProjectDiscovery tools to find subdomains, ports, and endpoints that are exposed on the internet. 

   - *Note: We are actively building this feature. Discovery will continue to expand and improve to reflect the robust scope found in our open source tools.*

- **Cloud Integration** - This feature supports numerous cloud service providers (AWS,GCP, Azure, CloudFlare, Fastly, and others). Once integration is configured the Cloud Platform polls the configured cloud service provider to continuously update
for any changes made by your team.

## Add Assets

In addition to upload, you have two other options to add assets. You can configure a Cloud Integration, or use Discovery. 

### Add a Cloud Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Assets">
    Navigate to https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/assets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select to Add">
    Choose **Cloud Integrations** from the subsections at the top and **Connect New**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a cloud provider">
    Select from the available cloud service providers and provide the configuration details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify config">
    Select **Verify** to complete the configuration and get the Cloud Platform started on discovering your assets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add Discovery

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Assets">
    Navigate to https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/assets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select to Add">
    Choose **Discovery** from the sections at the top and select **Auto Discovery**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide your Asset details">
    Name your Assets and provide the domains, IPs, or CIDR ranges you want to enumerate. Select the discovery settings you 
    want to apply and the frequency to check for newly added assets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create config">
    Select **Create** to complete the configuration and get the Cloud Platform started on discovering your assets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

With a Cloud Integration or Discovery, you are now setup to ensure that the assets you added are maintained and up to date for scanning.  


## What's Next? 

Now that you've defined the Assets you want to include on the Cloud Platform you can move on to building your scans to detect vulnerabilities.
