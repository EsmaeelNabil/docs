## Summary 

Review this example to walk through the steps you need te set up a continuous scan. PDCP scanning focuses on providing speed and accuracy around the 
vulnerabilities we identify. We want to ensure that you results are not filled with noise and help focus on the exploitable vulnerabilities that reflect the greatest risk. 

To set up continuous scanning you will need:

- The assets you care about. Refer to our user guide on [What is exposed?](/cloud/examples/addassets) to add your assets.
- Creating a scan schedule to check for recent changes that may reflect new vulnerabilities.
- Send notifications to your preferred channels (Ticketing or Alerts!) *By default, these alerts are sent to email.*
  - Check out the [Scan Integrations](/cloud/scanning/integrations)for details.

With these things set, the Cloud Platform can continuously run scans for you.

## Create a Continuous Scan

Follow the steps outlined below to create a new continuous scan. 

 - *Note: To include an alert or ticket creation as part of the scan you will need to 
have configured an integration. You can add an integration during the scan set up steps below or update an existing or previously created scan to add the integration.* 


<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Scans">
    Navigate to https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/scans and select **Create New Scan** to open the workflow to create a new scan. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Assets and templates">
    Select (or add) the assets you want to include in your scheduled scan. Click **Next** and select the templates you want to use for this scan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan Frequency">
    Give the scan a name and select your scan frequency to configure how often you want this scan to run. 

     - *You have to set up a schedule to enable a continuous scan.*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrations">
    Select **Integrate** to choose an existing Integration, or configure the new integration you want to use with this scan. 
    
    - *You can also **Update** this scan after it is created to add the Integration.*
  </Step>  

</Steps>

## What's Next?

Once your scan has completed successfully for the first time you will see the scan results on the main **Results** tab as part of your full results. 
Select the individual scan you just created from the **Scans** page to see the results for the individual scan. 

Explore these results to learn more about any vulnerabilities we identified and the details around the timing, templates, severity and more.
