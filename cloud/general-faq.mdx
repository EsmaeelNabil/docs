<Accordion title="What happens when I upgrade to Pro?">

Upgrading to the Pro tier starts at $100/month. Once you upgrade you receive 5000 scan tokens.

 A scan is a single evaluation for vulnerabilities (i.e., a scan powered by the Nuclei engine) of a single asset (an IP, URL, Domain) using any number of Nuclei templates.

  - Learn more about our [Nuclei templates](/templates/introduction) and our Cloud Platform [template editor](/cloud/editor/overview).

 </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do scan tokens work?">

 A single scan token provides one scan. Tokens are offered in a subscription model and can be revised at any time (increased or decreased in subscription). 

 - Tokens are withdrawn from an account after a scan has been initiated. 
 - If you cancel a scan within the first 2 minutes, tokens are refunded to your account.
 - Tokens are refunded for any scans that fail to complete.  
 - Unused tokens do not roll over from month to month.

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="How do I subscribe to PDCP?">

 If you have an existing ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform account, you can subscribe under Settings --> Billing to purchase scan tokens.

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="What happens if I reach my scan limit?">
 You will be notified prior to running a scan if you do not have sufficient tokens to complete the scan. You can reconfigure the scan with fewer assets or upgrade your account to purchase more tokens.

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="How do I upgrade my plan to get more tokens?">

 Upgrades are available in the Billing section of the Settings page. This can be done at any time within a billing cycle and you will immediately get access to the additional tokens from the upgrade. Upgrading a plan increases the subscription amount for future billing cycles unless you decide to downgrade. 
 You can upgrade to up to 14,000 tokens per month or a $1,000 / mo plan. 

 If your workflows require greater scanning capacity, please reach out to us at sales@projectdiscovery.io.
