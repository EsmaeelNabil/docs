<Accordion title="Are there use cases that are prohibited?">

Unlike Nuclei and our other open source tools, the Cloud Platform is not designed for use on bug bounty programs (public or private).

 A scan is a single evaluation for vulnerabilities (i.e., a scan powered by the Nuclei engine) of a single asset using any number of Nuclei templates. 

 Learn more about our [Nuclei templates](/templates/introduction) and our Cloud Platform [template editor](/cloud/editor/overview).

<Accordion title="How do scan tokens work?">

 A single scan token provides one scan. Tokens are offered in a subscription model and can be revised at any time (increased or decreased in subscription). 

 </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is an asset?">

 An asset is a single target - IP, URL, or Domain. For example, blog.website.com is a single asset. 

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="How do I subscribe to PDCP?">

 If you have an existing ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform account, you can subscribe under Settings --> Billing to purchase scan tokens.

    - For new users, visit https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/ to sign up. 

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="How are scan tokens consumed?">
 Tokens are withdrawn from an account after a scan has been initiated. 1 scan uses one token. 

 If you cancel a scan within the first 2 minutes, tokens are refunded to your account. Tokens are also refunded for any scans that fail to complete.  

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="Do tokens roll over from month to month?">

 No, tokens do not automatically roll over from month to month. 

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="What happens if I reach my scan limit?">
 You will be notified prior to running a scan if you do not have sufficient tokens to complete the scan. You can reconfigure the scan with fewer assets or upgrade your account to purchase more tokens.

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="How do I upgrade my plan to get more tokens?">

 Upgrades are available in the Billing section of the Settings page. This can be done at any time within a billing cycle and you will immediately get access to the additional tokens from the upgrade. Upgrading a plan increases the subscription amount for future billing cycles unless you decide to downgrade. 
 You can upgrade to up to 14,000 tokens per month or a $1,000 / mo plan. 

 If your workflows require greater scanning capacity, please reach out to us at sales@projectdiscovery.io.

 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="How do I downgrade my plan?">
