## Overview

In this section we'll walk through the steps you need to run a scan in [Nuclei](/tools/nuclei/overview) and connect your scan to ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP). 

## Set up your API Key

To connect your existing Nuclei results to PDCP you will need to create a free API Key 


    1.  Visit https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io 
    2. Open the setting menu from the top right and select "API Key" to create your API Key

    3.  Use the `nuclei -auth` command, and enter your API key when prompted.


## Run a Scan

To run a scan, from a terminal window with your Nuclei installation, use the `nuclei -target` or `nuclei -u` option to designate a target/host. 

**For example, a command might look like:**

```bash
nuclei -target http://honey.scanme.sh -cloud-upload
```

 - This example uses a sample site from ProjectDiscovery (http://honey.scanme.sh) 
 - The `-cloud-upload` flag is required to share results with PDCP
 - You can run this command against any URL you want (with appropriate permissions)
 - To reduce or narrow the scan results you can select a specific template folder for your scan
    - For example `nuclei -u http://buffer.com -t dns/ -cloud-upload` 

**And the output of your command (scan) would be:**

```console
                     __     _
   ____  __  _______/ /__  (_)
  / __ \/ / / / ___/ / _ \/ /

## Viewing Your Scan

After the scan is complete a URL will display on the command line interface. Visit this URL to check your results in PDCP. 

<img src="/images/pdcp-result-dashboard.png" alt="PDCP Result Dashboard"/>

Your scan results will also be available in the Scan tab of PDCP with a generic system generated name. You can rename the scan to identify it later.

After more than one scan "results" tab shows the scan results for all scans in your PDCP environment.

<Warning>
Nuclei scans connected and uploaded to PDCP are scheduled for automatic cleanup after 30 days. This duration is subject to change as we gauge user feedback and requirements.
