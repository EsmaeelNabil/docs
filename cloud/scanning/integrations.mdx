## Summary

ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP) includes integrations for several third-party tools with different user goals in mind. This includes tools that can keep your team up to date with real time alerts like email or Slack. 

PDCP can also help automate the remediation process with direct integration to ticketing systems like Jira and GitHub.

Visit [Scans --> Configurations](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/scans/configs) to access the integrations outlined below. 

<Info> Check out our [Scans and Vulnerabilities docs](/cloud/scanning/createscans) for high-level information on creating a scan and reviewing your vulnerabilities. </Info>

## Alerting Integrations

Alerting integrations offer support for notifications as part of scanning and include Slack, Microsoft Teams, Email, and custom Webhooks.

### Slack

PDCP supports scan notifications through Slack. To enable Slack notifications provide a name for your Configuration, a webhook, and an optional username. 

Choose from the list of **Events** (Scan Started, Scan Finished, Scan Failed) to specify what notifications are generated. Events are all select by default 

 - Refer to Slack's [documentation on creating webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for additional details. 

 ### MS Teams

PDCP supports notifications through Microsoft Teams. To enable notifications, provide a name for your Configuration and a corresponding webhook.

Choose from the list of **Events** (Scan Started, Scan Finished, Scan Failed)  to specify what notifications are generated.

- Refer to [Microsoft’s documentation on creating webhooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet) for additional details.

### Email

PDCP supports notifications via Email. To enable email notifications for completed scans simply add the desired email addresses.

Check out a sample email below.

### Webhook

PDCP supports notifications via custom Webhook. This functionality supports posting events from any user-defined endpoint based on your environment and system requirements. 
 
To enable webhook notifications for completed scans provide a config name, webhook URL, and the required authentication details. 

For example, you could send a custom webhook to an internal alerting system:

`https://example.com/hook/alert`

## Ticketing

The integrations under Ticketing offer support for ticketing functionality as part of scanning and include Jira, GitHub, and GitLab.

### Jira

PDCP provides integration support for Jira that includes creating new tickets when vulnerabilities are found. 

Provide a name for the configuration, the Jira instance URL , the Account ID, the Email, and the associated API token. 

Details on creating an API token are available [in the Jira documentation here.](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)

### GitHub

PDCP provides integration support for GitHub to support the creation of new tickets when vulnerabilities are found. 

Provide a name for the configuration, the Organization or username, Project name, Issue Assignee, Token, and Issue Label. The Issue Label determines when a ticket is created. (For example, if critical severity is selected, any issues with a critical severity will create a ticket.)  

 - The severity as label option adds a template result severity to any issues created. 
 - Deduplicate posts any new results as comments on existing issues instead of creating new issues for the same result. 

Details on setting up access in GitHub are available here. 

### GitLab

ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform provides integration support for GitLab to support the creation of new tickets when vulnerabilities are found. Provide your GitLab username, Project name, Project Access Token and a GitLab Issue label. The Issue Label determines when a ticket is created. 
(For example, if critical severity is selected, any issues with a critical severity will create a ticket.)  

 - The severity as label option adds a template result severity to any GitLab issues created. 
 - Deduplicate posts any new results as comments on existing issues instead of creating new issues for the same result. 

 Refer to GitLab’s documentation for details on [configuring a Project Access token.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#create-a-project-access-token) 

## Scan Configs
Use scan configurations to implement custom http headers, template variables, and custom interactsh server for your scans.


## Template Configs

Review our built in template configurations or create a new template configuration with template filters to include or exclude based on severity, tags, protocol, and template ID.
