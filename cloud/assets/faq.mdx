## General

### Basic Asset Details
**Is there a limitation on how many Assets I can add?**

There is no overall storage limit for Assets. Each individual upload of Assets cannot exceed 50,000 items.

**What kind of assets are supported?**

Assets or hosts can be a URL, an IP address, or a CIDR range. 

**Can everyone in my team see all the Assets that were added to my environment?**

Yes, all assets in your PDCP environment are shared across your team.

### Assets and Scans

**Can I exempt specific assets from a scan?**

Building a new scan requires you to choose assets as part of the scan configuration, so yes, scans will apply to whatever assets you include in the scan. 

### Adding and Modifying Assets

**What's the difference between uploading Assets and using Asset Discovery?**

Upload allows you to choose a list of individual assets to add via list or TXT file and Asset Discovery allows you to designate a range or domain and any associated subdomains will be identified by PDCP and added as individual assets/hosts.

**Can I edit existing Assets?** 
Yes! Assets that are added to PDCP can be renamed and deleted.
