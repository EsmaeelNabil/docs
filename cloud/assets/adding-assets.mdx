## Summary
Assets are any hosts added to ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP) for scanning. Hosts can be a URL, an IP address, or a CIDR range.

Assets can be added through either the Assets tab, or during the creation of a scan. Regardless of the path, adding assets to the Cloud Platform is the first step to running a scan and securing your tech stack against exploitable vulnerabilities. 

From the Assets tab, there are three methods to add your assets: 
 - Asset Upload
 - Discovery
 - Cloud Integration

 Each unique path, including those with specified ports will be added as an individual asset for scanning. If you have questions about your specific setup, get in touch with us at support@projectdiscovery.io.

 ## Asset Upload

 Upload is the most basic method of getting assets into PDCP. If you want to get started immediately to test things out with a single domain, this is a straightforward way to add a single domain and immediately start a scan.

- Manually input your list, or upload an existing list (.TXT) of up to 50,000 items. 

- Use domain, IP address, or CIDR. For CIDR ranges each individual domain will be added as a single asset.


## Discovery

Asset Discovery is one of the Cloud Platformâ€™s most convenient asset features. Add your assets (domain, IP address, or CIDR range) and asset discovery can enumerate the associated assets for you using our open source tools like subfinder and katana. 

*Note: This feature is being actively developed to include the robust scope and visibility you have come to expect from our open source tools.*

Configure auto-discovery settings to continuously monitor for updates on a scheduled basis. Update assets as often as hourly or as infrequently as monthly, or with a custom interval.

Discovery Settings:

- Selecting **Recommended** enumerates subdomains, scans for open ports, and checks for live HTTP response codes. 

- To crawl for endpoints, you can select **Custom** and check all four options (Hosts, Ports, HTTP Service, Endpoints).

Results will be grouped by hosts (subdomains), ports (hosts with open ports), HTTP (hosts with 200 OK HTTP status code) and endpoints. These four pages deduplicate before a scan is run.

Used in combination with a scheduled scan you can ensure continuous visibility across your tech stack.

## Cloud Integrations

Cloud Integrations connect your PDCP environment to any of our supported cloud providers and pull in assets once connected.

Cloud Integrations for Assets can be configured to check for updates to your assets and ensure your information is up to date. 

For the majority of integrations, you only need to provide a name and the token or access details generated by the provider. 

## Managing Assets

Once your assets are added they display in an asset list under the category associated with the method of upload. (Uploads display under **Uploads**, **Discovery** has auto-discovered assets, and **Cloud integrations** displays all assets added under the cloud integrations tab). 

*Note: We are working to improve the overall experience and plan to have assets in a single unified view in a future iteration of the Cloud Platform.*


 - Use the context menu **Update** to add or remove assets, revise the name with Rename, or Delete.
 - Uploaded assets are immediately available to use in scans.
 - Assets that are part of an existing scan cannot be deleted.
