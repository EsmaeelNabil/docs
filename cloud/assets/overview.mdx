## Overview
Assets are any hosts added to ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP) for scanning. Hosts can be a URL, an IP address, or a CIDR range. 

The Assets page is available from the top navigation. Assets can be added through Uploads, Discovery, and Cloud Integrations.

Each Asset section supports search, refresh, and lists the added assets available to browse. Once you've added assets to PDCP through any of the available methods 
they are available to include in scans you want to create.
