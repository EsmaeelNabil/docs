## Overview
Assets are any hosts added to ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP) for scanning. Hosts can be a URL, an IP address, or a CIDR range. 

The Assets page is available from the top navigation. Assets are currently divided between Uploads, Discovery, and Cloud Integrations.

Each page supports search, refresh, and lists the added assets available to browse. Once you've added assets to PDCP through any of the available methods 
they are available to include in scans you want to create.


## Adding Assets

PDCP currently supports adding assets with three options: upload, asset discovery, and  cloud integration. 


### Upload

Assets are uploaded individually or through a .TXT file. 

### Asset Discovery

Assets are added through domains, IP address, or CIDR. PDCP automatically enumerates the related assets.
