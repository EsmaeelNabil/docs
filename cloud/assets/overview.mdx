## Overview
Assets are any hosts added to your ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP) environment for scanning. Hosts can be a URL, an IP address, or a CIDR range. 

The Assets page is available from the top navigation. The Assets page includes search, refresh, and listed assets to browse. You can upload assets through a general upload or through asset discovery. 
Interact with individual assets through a context menu to rename, update, download, delete. 

Once you've added assets to PDCP they are available to include in any new scans you want to create.


## Adding Assets

PDCP currently supports adding assets with three options: upload, asset discovery, or cloud integration.

### Upload

Assets are uploaded individually or through a .TXT file. 

### Asset Discovery

Assets are added through domains, IP address, or CIDR. PDCP automatically enumerates the related assets. 

### General 

 - There is no overall storage limit for Assets
 - An individual upload of Assets cannot exceed 50,000 items
 - Deleting assets that are part of an existing scan will generate an error
