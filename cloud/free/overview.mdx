## Overview

ProductDiscovery Cloud Platform (PDCP) is a hosted enterprise product for continuous visibility and vulnerability scanning. PDCP is currently offered [in two pricing tiers](https://projectdiscovery.io/pricing), Free and Teams. 

The Free tier is a great way for existing ProjectDiscovery users, familiar with our open source solutions, to connect their Nuclei scans with PDCP 

If you're new to ProjectDiscovery the Free tier is also a great way to get started with â€‹PDCP. 

**The Free Tier includes:**
 - Support to upload and view findings from Nuclei (_up to 1K per month_) 
 - Rescanning in PDCP
 - Sharing of findings from PDCP
 - [Template Editor](/editor/introduction) functionality and access to our AI Template Generator (_up to 50 per month_) 

## What do I need?

To get started with PDCP you'll need two things:

- Scan results from Nuclei
- a PDCP Login/Setup

If you're already a Nuclei user, or you've walked through our [Getting Started example](/getstarted-overview) using Nuclei, you're most of the way there. 

## What's in this User Guide?

In this documentation we're going to walk through:

 - Installing Nuclei as a new user
 - Setting up a new PDCP account
 - Generating an API key and authenticating your account
 - Connecting your Nuclei scan results to PDCP
 - Viewing scan results and exploring some features

<Note> If you already have Nuclei scan results skip to **Run a Scan** to connect. </Note>
