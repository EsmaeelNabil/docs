## Overview

Welcome to Getting Started! This section is designed to help you quickly install, set up, and scan using just a few parts of ProjectDiscoveryâ€™s suite of open-source tools.

The steps here are simple to get you insightful results with the quickest path possible. 
Because ProjectDiscovery has so many tools we're going to focus on a few to demonstrate some of our core product capabilities.

We do have a ton of other open-source tools that can enhance, expand, or adapt for your particular use cases. 
So if at the end of this process you still have questions - [reach out](/help).
